Are there places in the World where there have not yet been more than 10 total infections (as of 31 March)? If so, where are they? 
from the line 63-75
discussion: From the result, we can see that before march thirty-first in 2020, there are 42 places whose total cases are below 10 cases. 
Most of these places don't have large population. The mobility of population in most of these places is not strong. These situations result in low total cases.
