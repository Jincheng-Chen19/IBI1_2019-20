Fr this practical, I use the percentage to show the proportion of same amino acids between each two sequences.
And, I use BLOSUM62 as matrix, and compare the similarity between the protein sequences of human, mouse and random.
Result shows that human-mouse score is much higher than the scores of human-random and mouse-random.
And, the percentage of human-mouse is also the highest one.
From the both results, it is obvious that human sequence and mouse sequence are much more similar compared with random sequence.
Human and mouse may have a relatively recent common ancestor, which causes this similarity.
