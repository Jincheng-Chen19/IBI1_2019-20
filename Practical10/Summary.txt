For this practical, I use the percentage to show the proportion of the same amino acids between every two sequences.
I use BLOSUM62 as the matrix and compare the similarity between the protein sequences of human, mouse, and random.
The result shows that the human-mouse score is much higher than the scores of human-random and mouse-random.
The percentage of human-mouse is also the highest one.
From both results, it is obvious that the human sequence and mouse sequence are much more similar compared with the random sequence.
Human and mouse may have a relatively recent common ancestor, which causes this similarity.
